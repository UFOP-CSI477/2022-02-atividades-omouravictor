# Blood Donation API

Rest API created with spring-boot and Kotlin language for managing blood donations.

## Requirements to run the application:

  - Start up a MySQL database server on port 3306 on your localhost. (XAMPP can be used for this).
  - Have the MySQL JDBC driver installed (the driver can be downloaded directly from Intellij).
  - Make sure there isn't a schema with the name "blood_donation_db" because when running the project a schema with this name will be automatically created.

## Some features of the application:

Note: The createdAt and updatedAt attributes are automatically saved and managed by the application.
